#dataPipelineProject

## Project Details

This project explores the use of goroutine applications for building data pipelines in Go. The origial pipeline and code respository was created by Amrit Singh, and the repository can be found here [Github] https://github.com/code-heim/go_21_goroutines_pipeline.

The repository was cloned using the git clone command and the Github repo URL.

The go build command was used to build and the program was run. The output from that original build was saved in the init_build.txt for documenting purposes. Proper error checking was added to the image file input and output sections in the image_processing.go file. The original code included a panic that would stop the execution of the program. It is best practice to return errors from a function, allowing the caller of the function to handle the error. The load and save images functions on the main.go file were also updated to reflect these changes to error handling. Four new images were added to the program. All four images were generated by Google Gemini, (Bard, Google AI. (2024)). 

Unit testing was added in the `main_test.go` file. The code in the program focuses on each compenent of the pipleline, read, write, grayscale, resize indavidulaly and the pipeline itself. When run the tests all pass. For documentation purposes, the output generated for the tests can be found in the testing.txt file. Benchmarking was also included for each stage of the pipeline and then for the pipeline as a whole. According to the benchmark output, also found in the testing.txt file, loadIamge took 2 seconds, resizeImage took 4.4 seconds, ConvertToGrayscale took 4.5 seconds, and SaveImage took 4.6 seconds to run. Interestingly, when `go test bench=.` was run, to run the benchmark sequetionally, my system crashed each time. The final component, which is the entirity of the pipeline, all at once ran in 40 seconds.

In addition to adding error handling, code modifications were conduction in the main.go file. The original code provide images in the main function as impout, however this section of the program was hardcoded. To avoid hard coding, the main function was modified and an additional function was added titled runPipeline. The purpose of this addtion was to incorporate command-line arguments and pass them to runPipeline to allow for a program that is more reusable with any images.

### Running the Program
In the terinal, navigate to the directory that contains go_routines.exe

**Type**: ./program.exe image_path/image

For this program it should look like this:

./goroutines_pipeline.exe images/1.jpg images/2.jpg images/3.jpg images/4.jpg

**OUTPUT**
Success!
Success!
Success!
Success!
Pipeline complete!

If the command line arguments are incorrect the user will see this message:
Usage: program_name image_path1 image_path2 ...
